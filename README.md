## Imports

utility - used for the pair data structure
vector - used for the vector data structure
iostream - allows to read and output data to and from the terminal
random - randomization of bomb positioning
set - used for the set data structure

## Usage

The game will prompt the user for both the size of the board and number of bombs wanted. It will then display a grid with a 0 indexed grid on both axes. The user then can choose a selection on this grid to start the game. It will update the display for the user and prompt again until the game is finished, either from the revealing of all non-bomb squares or when the user attempts to reveal a bomb.
